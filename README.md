# Directory-Platform-for-Surgeons
In this project, I developed a directory for surgions so they can signup on a free/paid monthly/yearly plan. Surgions can post their surgery bundles which patients can search. Patients or users can contact with the surgions. Surgions can also post surgery centers so users can search them and visit. Services were surgery, plastic surgery etc.
# Surgeon Directory: Connecting Surgeons with Patients

The **Surgeon Directory** is a specialized platform built to connect **surgeons** and **patients**.

Patients can easily search for surgeons, view surgery bundles, and contact them directly. Surgeons can also post their surgery centers, enabling patients to find and visit these centers. The services offered through the platform include various surgeries, including **plastic surgery**, and many others.
